## 2025-05-14 - Accessible Interactive Components Pattern
**Learning:** Many interactive components in this application (like the account selector and toggles) were implemented using `div` elements with click handlers. This breaks keyboard accessibility and screen reader support. Using semantic `button` elements and appropriate ARIA roles (like `role="switch"` or `aria-haspopup`) is essential for accessibility. Additionally, the `vite-plugin-html-include` pattern means that improvements to shared fragments like `_sidebar.html` have an outsized positive impact on the overall application's UX.
**Action:** Always check if a clickable `div` can be replaced with a `button` and ensure shared fragments are prioritized for accessibility improvements.

## 2025-05-15 - Resilient DOM Traversal for Input Effects
**Learning:** When adding interactive elements like password visibility toggles that require nesting inputs in new wrapper elements (e.g., `relative` containers), existing DOM-traversal-based scripts (like those using `parentElement`) can break. Using `.closest()` in event listeners provides a more resilient way to target container elements for animations or state changes, regardless of the nesting depth.
**Action:** Use `.closest()` instead of `parentElement` when writing scripts that interact with the parent containers of form inputs to ensure compatibility with nested UI enhancements.

## 2025-05-16 - Search and Selection Micro-UX
**Learning:** Adding a "Clear search" button and auto-focusing the search input upon opening a dropdown significantly reduces friction for users navigating large lists. Combining these with `aria-live` for search results ensures that the UI remains accessible and communicative for screen reader users during real-time filtering.
**Action:** Always include a clear mechanism for reset in search inputs and ensure focus management is handled during modal/dropdown transitions.
